          <h1>About us</h1>
          <p>
            Guerdon foundation is a youth-led non-profit organization carrying a
            focused mission of supporting the lives of the homeless in Sri
            Lanka. Our goal is to lend an additional and reliable hand to not
            only refine the lives of the homeless but to also reduce the number
            of them in Sri Lanka.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have two programs: The feeding program and the monthly
            distribution of care packages. Apart from this, we also help the
            homeless with their specific needs like school supplies for
            children, help for pregnant mothers, help for parents who want to
            enroll their children in school, employment opportunities for the
            able-bodied who are willing to work and many more. Join our
            community of volunteers to help us carry out our mission!

            <h2>Why we started guerdon foundation</h2>
            <p>
              Homeless people are the embodiment of the fallacy that Human
              rights are always bettering the lives of the unfortunate. Although
              they are present at a global scale, Sri Lanka is chiefly infamous
              for having an overwhelming number of homeless people; ranging
              between piteous figures of 85,000 to 100,000.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It goes without saying that the homeless live a harsh life. Sadly,
              a lot of us, though not all, look through the torn clothes, watch
              their grimed, hashed skin and fail to regard that all of it is
              enveloping a living human with human feelings; most similar to you
              in terms of genome and soul. Life as a homeless person is many
              things at once; it is a constant race of survival, keeping human
              whilst being continually bombarded by insatiable hunger, feelings
              of hopelessness and helplessness.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Whatâ€™s even more depressing is that a majority of the homeless
              were once people living in privilege, their tongues aware of the
              taste of luxury. They were people with dreams and talent all
              falling victim under bad circumstances thrown by life. Many were
              abandoned by their very own children for whom they worked
              tirelessly to achieve them a great life; while some chose this
              life as an escape from the hostile environment of Orphanages they
              were put in by force and then the hapless victims who were born
              into poverty. Apart from the innumerable predicaments they face
              from sustaining an unsanitary lifestyle to living in a vicious
              cycle of poverty, the children are stripped from their rights for
              education, a crafted recipe for a never ending cycle of poverty.
