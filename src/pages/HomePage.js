          <h1>About us</h1>
          <p>
            The Guerdon Foundation is an non-profit organization carrying a focused mission of
            supporting the lives of the beggars In Sri Lanka. Our goal is to
            lend an additional and reliable hand to not only refine the lives of
            beggars but also to reduce the number of them in Sri Lanka.
          </p>

            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>The life of a beggar</h2>
            <p>
              Beggars are the embodiment of the fallacy that Human rights are
              always bettering the lives of the unfortunate. Although beggars
              are present at a global scale, Sri Lanka is chiefly infamous for
              having an overwhelming number of beggars; ranging between piteous
              figures of 85,000 to 100,000.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It goes without saying that beggars live a harsh life. Sadly, a
              lot of us, though not all, look through the torn clothes, watch
              their grimed, hashed skin and fail to regard that all of it is
              enveloping a living human with human feelings; most similar to you
              in terms of genome and soul. Life as a Beggar is many things at
              once; it is a constant race of survival, keeping human whilst
              being continually bombarded by insatiable hunger, feelings of
              hopelessness and helplessness.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Whatâ€™s even more depressing is that a majority of beggars were
              once people living in privilege, their tongues aware of the taste
              of luxury. They were people with dreams and talent all falling
              victim under bad circumstances thrown by life. Many were abandoned
              by their very own children for whom they worked tirelessly to
              achieve them a great life; while some chose this life as an escape
              from the hostile environment of Orphanages they were put in by
              force and then the hapless victims who were born into poverty.
              Apart from the innumerable predicaments they face from sustaining
              an unsanitary lifestyle to living in a vicious cycle of poverty,
              the children are stripped from their rights for education, a
              crafted recipe for a never ending cycle of Beggary.
